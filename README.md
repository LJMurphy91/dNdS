# dNdS

Pipeline to identify dNdS ratios for <i> Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv </i> and <i> Mycobacterium canettii </i> various strain orthologs

This method was utilised to generate dN values or relative values for the number of non-synonymous substitutions in MTB / STB orthologs to get an overview of gene divergence between the two species.
